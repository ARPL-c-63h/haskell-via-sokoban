Haskell via Sokoban
-------------------

This is the source repository for the “Haskell via Sokoban“ Haskell lecture. If
you want to read the lecture notes, you very likely want to go to
<http://haskell-via-sokoban.nomeata.de/>.

Contributions to the text, e.g. fixing typos or such, are welcome. Just edit
the Markdown files and/or the code in `code/` and create a pull request.

The `Makefile` will upload the code in `code/` to CodeWorld and remember the
identifiers used by CodeWorld, and the `subst.pl` script substitutes them into
the document.
